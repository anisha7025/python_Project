Dick Gibb was our Realtor and we were very impressed with the service we received. A year or so later, Dick called to see how we liked the home and how our family was adjusting to Omaha. He asked me if I was interested in a part time position working for him as an administrative assistant. I held my Master's Degree in Elementary Education but found that profession cumbersome while raising my own children. I interviewed with the understanding that I would work remotely so that I could be at home with my kids. Now, over two decades later, I am still working in that capacity and have since gotten my real estate license. I enjoy showing buyers potential homes and have also obtained certification as a Military Relocation Specialist. If you are considering making a move, it would be a privilege to assist you in your search.

It took us an incredibly long time to find what we were looking for, but she patiently showed us house after house.

Because she listened. Unlike the many other realtors I'd tried and dismissed, she immediately wanted to find out what my needs were. Asking insightful, relevant questions she not only uncovered quickly what I wanted but also made me think about some things I hadn't even considered. Then she found us a house in a neighborhood that I hadn't considered - and we wound up buying it. She was totally professional, thorough, responsive, forthright and scrupulously honest throughout the transaction and helped us smooth out some lumpy deal elements with finesse.
